- 👀 I’m interested in Backend Developer Position Golang / NetDevOps / Python or SRE. My rich brain is very expensive - think well before.
- 🌱 I’m always learning new techs stack mainly into backend systems design & developement and cloud native networking.
- 🌱 I’m on some spare time teaching / mentoring people into coding and building my own [online learning platform](https://learn.cloudmentor-scale.com)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any great Open Source Software Projects which involve networking aspects and software. I am really fast.
